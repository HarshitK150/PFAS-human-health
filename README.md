## Overview

This project investigates the health impacts of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), commonly known as "forever chemicals." These synthetic compounds are widely used in consumer products and have raised concerns due to their persistence in the environment and potential health risks.

## Objectives

- **Identify Sources**: Explore various industrial and consumer products that contain PFAS.
- **Assess Health Effects**: Review research linking PFAS exposure to adverse health outcomes.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Discuss current approaches to reduce PFAS exposure.

## Key Findings

- PFAS are found in products like non-stick cookware and food packaging.
- Exposure is linked to health issues such as cancer and immune system effects.
- Effective mitigation requires regulatory action and public awareness.

## Conclusion

Understanding PFAS and their implications is crucial for public health and environmental policy. Continued research and advocacy are essential to mitigate risks associated with these chemicals.
